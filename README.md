# Repo Description

In this folder, I’ve included the projects with significant programming components which I’ve completed during my Applied Math master’s program. The projects are organized by course. Each project has a pdf write up - usually including visualizations or a summary of the code that I wrote. In each project, I also included my source code. Most code is written in MATLAB, although some is in python using the fenics library for solving partial differential equations. 

# DISCLAIMER
Note that my professors often provided functions or other code files for me to use in my own code. This code is included in these folders as well. If you are interested in whether I wrote a specific piece of code, you are welcome to contact me. The pdf write-ups of each projects also often make it clear which code was provided to me in advance.
